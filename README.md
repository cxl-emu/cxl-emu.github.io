We are pleased to announce the launch of the CXL Emulation Workgroup, an initiative designed to tackle challenges within the CXL ecosystem, such as cache coherency, scalability, and the constrained availability of CXL hardware. We warmly invite the community to engage, share expertise, and collaborate to propel CXL-enabled hyperscale computing.
